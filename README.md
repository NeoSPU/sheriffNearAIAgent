**Near AI rAIxon Sheriff Agent**

**Overview**

The **Near AI rAIxon Sheriff Agent** is designed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts within the **Near AI ecosystem** and across various blockchain networks. Timely detection of vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of decentralized applications (dApps), preventing exploits, and maintaining trust within the blockchain community.

**Functionality**

The **rAIxon Sheriff Agent** operates by analyzing smart contract code or code fragments provided by the user. It cross-references identified vulnerabilities against established knowledge bases, such as **Amazon Berock**, **Amazon OpenSearch**, and the **Vector Store** of the Near AI platform.

The agent's core functionality is driven by the integration of **Near AI Agents** with these knowledge bases and vector storage, allowing for efficient retrieval and analysis of security-related data.

**Advanced Capabilities**

To enhance its expertise in vulnerability detection, **rAIxon Sheriff** leverages the **Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern**, which enables it to access and process vast amounts of security data efficiently. The agent utilizes a specialized **knowledge base of smart contract vulnerabilities**, built using reputable sources such as:

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**
- **CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog)**
- **EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)**
- **BCCC (Blockchain Cybersecurity Center)**

This approach ensures that the agent remains up to date with the latest security threats and best practices for mitigating risks in blockchain-based applications.

**Data Sources for Vulnerability Analysis**

For a comprehensive assessment of smart contract security, **rAIxon Sheriff** utilizes publicly available datasets and research, including:

- [Smart Contract Dataset by Messi-Q](https://github.com/Messi-Q/Smart-Contract-Dataset)
- [Blockchain Cybersecurity Center (BCCC) - UCS Technical](https://www.yorku.ca/research/bccc/ucs-technical/)

**Importance of Timely Vulnerability Detection**

With the growing adoption of smart contracts in decentralized ecosystems, security remains a top priority. Exploits and vulnerabilities can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and disruptions in blockchain networks. By leveraging **Near AI rAIxon Sheriff**, developers, auditors, and security researchers can proactively detect and mitigate security risks, ensuring a more robust and resilient blockchain infrastructure.
